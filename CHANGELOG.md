# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork will be listed here.

## Unreleased

- Project setup required banner with 24h snooze (Expand stays locked until spec is real)
- Project reset endpoint (runtime reset + full reset) and UI Danger Zone controls
- Knowledge files (`/knowledge/*.md`) injected into prompts + UI editor modal
- Single-agent loop exits when no pending/staged/verification features remain
- Clarified prompt guidance: refactor/cleanup features are mandatory and override the original spec
- Regression selection now prioritizes least-tested features (tracks `regression_count`)
- UI auto-build now detects stale `ui/dist` and rebuilds when sources are newer
- UI auto-build shows which file triggered rebuild; optional mtime tolerance for FAT32/exFAT (`AUTOCODER_UI_MTIME_TOLERANCE_S`)
- WebSocket debug logs deduplicate consecutive identical lines (prevents StrictMode double-connect noise)
- Assistant chat: avoid history loss on conversation switch, disable input while loading, and reduce server log noise
- Scheduled runs (UI) with persisted schedule state
- New `AUTOCODER_STOP_WHEN_DONE` toggle to keep agents alive on empty queues
- LAN-ready UI host toggle (`AUTOCODER_UI_HOST`, `AUTOCODER_UI_ALLOW_REMOTE`)
- Windows CLI length guard for assistant chat via temporary `CLAUDE.md`
- Atomic per-project agent lock (`<project>/.agent.lock`) + PID-reuse protection + stop kills full process tree
- SQLite defaults to WAL, but falls back to DELETE on network filesystems (override via `AUTOCODER_SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE`)
- Fix: fresh projects no longer exit early before initializer creates features
- Agent auto-continue: improved “limit reached” parsing (resets-at variants) + 24h clamp
- MCP `feature_create_bulk`: validate inputs before writing to DB
- Worker logs: copy tail to clipboard
- Playwright MCP now runs with `--isolated` by default (disable with `AUTOCODER_PLAYWRIGHT_ISOLATED=0`)
- Fix: Gatekeeper verify-branch sanitization is Python 3.10 compatible
- Fix: `test_mcp` includes missing `json` import
